[AngularDart][angulardart] is an open-source web framework focused on
productivity, performance, and stability. Originally developed by Google,
AngularDart has powered sophisticated, mission-critical apps that serve millions
of users. It is built on [Dart](https://dart.dev/web) and has been used
extensively in production, including but not limited to Google AdWords, Google
Fiber, Wrike, etc.

**Disclaimer**: This project is now maintained by the AngularDart Community.
This is not a Google product in any way, official or unofficial.
